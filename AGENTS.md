# Maintainer instructions

This repository owns the RemoteDesk DSH plugin. HarmonyOS application code belongs in Mydstiny/RemoteDeskHarmonyOS; never copy that checkout, its history or credentials here.

- The source of truth is this GitHub repository. The maintainer currently requests GitHub branch/commit/PR management; temporary local files are for validation only.
- This is AI0 engineering code, with no remote listener or paid feature enabled. Preserve that boundary until authentication, execution isolation and device acceptance pass.
- Read README.md, compatibility.json and docs/compatibility.md first. Use exact supported versions. Never read user account/session stores to diagnose compatibility.
- Keep changes on a task branch and create a PR. Run npm test, node syntax checks and npm pack --dry-run --ignore-scripts. Codex transport changes require the local probe; DSH lifecycle changes require test/native-runtime.mjs on the pinned runtime.
- Obtain an independent review before merge. Never commit secrets, machine paths, operational logs, generated upstream source, node_modules or floating dependency pins.
- Changes to upstream contracts require compatibility evidence, docs and NOTICE/provenance updates. Do not claim runtime or device coverage from fixture tests.
