# RemoteDesk DSH Plugin

The DSH host component for RemoteDesk's HarmonyOS Pro AI workspace. **0.1.0-alpha.1 is an AI0 engineering probe, not a remotely usable product.** This GitHub repository owns the plugin; HarmonyOS code is managed separately in [RemoteDeskHarmonyOS](https://github.com/Mydstiny/RemoteDeskHarmonyOS).

From a maintainer-verified immutable source revision, with Node.js 22 or later:

```sh
npm test
node bin/remotedesk-dsh.mjs doctor --json
```

No npm runtime dependencies or background services are installed. The current probe opens no network listener. A successful doctor result certifies only its listed checks; `capabilities.remoteAccess` stays false. Pairing, persistent remote control, full execution isolation, the HarmonyOS UI and RustDesk transport are not implemented.

Run `node test/native-runtime.mjs` against the accepted DSH installation for real Cordis lifecycle, SessionStore/AgentRegistry, approval cancellation and existing question-provider tests. The agent is a deterministic fixture, not a real model loop.

The planned HarmonyOS entitlement is the single lifetime Pro purchase (`pro.lifetime`). These tools do not mint purchase entitlements.

See [operations](docs/operations.md), [agent-assisted setup](docs/agent-deploy.md), [compatibility and evidence](docs/compatibility.md), [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md), and [中文文档](README.md). Full production installation instructions will accompany an actual supported release.
